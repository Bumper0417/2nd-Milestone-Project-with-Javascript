## Features

- This site uses button containers with a search button created with bootstrap.
- The Map that is displayed on the site is made with the places API and it makes users experience more visual and easy to access.
- The users are able to change the search criteria without reloading the page.
- This site provides all the information with a simple design made mostly with css.

## Features left to Implement

In the future i want to make the site more analytic using more functions that will allow users to put more criteria in search buttons and the background of the webpage will change every time the destination will change.
