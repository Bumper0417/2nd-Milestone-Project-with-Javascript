- This site uses button containers with a search button created with bootstrap.
- The Map that is displayed on the site is made with the places API and it makes users experience more visual and easy to access.
- The users are able to change the search criteria without reloading the page.
- This site provides all the information with a simple design made mostly with css.

## Features left to Implement
